# Network Analysis Term Project

This repo contains the project files and output for Dhruval Bhatt's term paper for Network Analysis course at University of Chicago. This project explores the structuralist viewpoint of economic dependency among nations using import-export date downloaded from UN COMTRADE's database. The analysis follows the block modelling technique as applied by  Ronald Breiger's in his work, “Structures of Economic Interdependence Among Nations”. While Breiger's analysis focused on 24 OECD nations of 1972, this analysis considers the same ones plus 13 additional OECD nations and 3 non-OECD nations, India, China and Brazil. The results show that the core-periphery structure proposed by world systems theory is still existent but different nations, play a dominant role.
